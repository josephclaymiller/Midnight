Midnight
========

Game demo using Corona SDK Graphics 2.0

Midnight is a demo of a game where you try and tap on different color dots that move around. The dots to select are colorized in the beginning of the level then go back to white to fit in with the other dots. You must remember which dots were shown at the beginning and select them. They will also move about the screen occasionally. You lose points by tapping the other dots on the screen.
